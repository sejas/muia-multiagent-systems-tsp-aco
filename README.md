In this jupyter notebook I've coded the Ant System, and ACO algorithm to resolve two TSP maps. It's interesting play with the parameters to fully understand the algorithm.

```python
import tsplib95
from random import randrange, random, shuffle
from bisect import bisect
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# import pixiedust
import numpy as np
```

```python
#!pip install ipython-autotime
%load_ext autotime
```

##Â Load TSP Problem

```python
# Data Source : http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html
#TSP_FILE = 'uy734.tsp' # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ Uruguay
TSP_FILE = 'wi29.tsp' # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡­ Western Sahara
```

    time: 314 Âµs

```python
# LOAD TSP FILE
PROBLEM = tsplib95.load(TSP_FILE)
print(type(PROBLEM))
```

    <class 'tsplib95.models.StandardProblem'>
    time: 2.45 ms

```python
PROBLEM.type
```

    'TSP'



    time: 2.03 ms

```python
N = len(list(PROBLEM.get_nodes())) # N is total cities
print("%s Cities"%N)
```

    29 Cities
    time: 579 Âµs

```python
# Example city coordinates
PROBLEM.node_coords[3]
```

    [21300.0, 13016.6667]



    time: 1.34 ms

```python
# Distance between first and last cities

PROBLEM.get_weight(**edge)
